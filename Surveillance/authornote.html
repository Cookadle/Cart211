                <h1>Author’s Note: Reclaiming My Privacy 
                    <br > Little Practical Steps to Outsmart Big Brother</h1>

        <p class="highlight">As a student in today’s hyper-connected world, I’ve come to realize how much of our daily lives are being tracked and controlled by Big Tech. While privacy may seem like a distant concept, I believe there are simple yet effective steps we can take to reduce surveillance and reclaim some autonomy over our data. Here’s how I’ve made changes in my own life to reduce the digital footprint I leave behind, with a focus on cutting out third-party surveillance and embracing a more privacy-conscious lifestyle.</p>

        <h1>1. Creating a Home Server for Media</h1>

        <p class="highlight">One of the most significant changes I’ve made is using a home server with curated by my partner, which has drastically reduced the need for streaming services like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube. Rather than relying on these corporate giants, we’ve archived every piece of media we own, from movies and TV shows to music and books, on the server. Not only does this give us more control over our content, but it also ensures that we don’t have to hand over our viewing habits to third parties.</p>

        <p class="highlight">With the home server, we use software that indexes and streams our own media library directly to our devices. This means that when we want to watch a film, we’re not handing over our personal data or preferences to companies that sell it to advertisers. Everything is stored locally, and we’ve even set up a private, password-protected access system for extra security.</p>

        <h1>2. Using Local Storage for Photos and Documents</h1>

        <p class="highlight">Another significant step I’ve taken is moving away from cloud-based storage services, like Google Photos and Google Drive. I now store all my important documents and photos on a dedicated hard drive. This allows me to access my files without worrying about them being scanned, indexed, or sold by tech companies. While it may seem inconvenient compared to the convenience of cloud services, the peace of mind that comes with knowing my data isn’t being monitored or sold is well worth the trade-off.</p>

        <p class="highlight">I’ve even started using encrypted external drives for sensitive documents, making it harder for anyone (or anything) to gain access without my consent. By taking these small but impactful steps, I can control who accesses my personal information and how it’s used.</p>

        <h1>3. Browsing the Web in Private</h1>

        <p class="highlight">When it comes to browsing the web, I’ve made a deliberate shift towards privacy-focused tools. Instead of using mainstream browsers like Google Chrome, which constantly tracks user behavior, I now use <strong>Linux-based operating systems</strong> on my laptop, such as Ubuntu, which offer better control over what data is being collected. I also use <strong>privacy-focused browsers</strong> like Firefox with various extensions, such as uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger, to block ads and trackers.</p>

        <p class="highlight">For search engines, I avoid Google’s ubiquitous data harvesting and instead use alternatives like <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> and <strong>Qwant</strong>, which don’t track your searches or build user profiles. These search engines are much more respectful of privacy, and though they might not be as powerful or refined as Google, they certainly meet my needs without compromising my data.</p>

        <h1>4. Navigating Piracy and Privacy Online</h1>

        <p class="highlight">Piracy might carry a certain stigma, but from a privacy standpoint, it offers an avenue to avoid relying on mainstream platforms that profit off your data. I’ve slowly started to embrace <strong>torrenting</strong> as a way to download content without handing over my personal information. Of course, there’s a fine line between legality and ethics, but I believe that torrenting through the <strong>Tor browser</strong> offers an additional layer of privacy and security. By using Tor, my IP address is masked, and my browsing is anonymized, making it harder for anyone to track what I’m downloading.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Additionally, I make it a point to <strong>seed</strong> files, helping to ensure that content remains accessible without central control by any one entity. While piracy might not be the solution for everyone, I find that it provides a sense of autonomy and freedom in an otherwise heavily surveilled digital landscape.</p>

        <h1>5. Letting Go of Big Tech: A Slow Transition</h1>

        <p class="highlight">Perhaps the most significant change I’ve made is the gradual phase-out of Big Tech products from my life. For years, I was tied to Apple, from the iPhone to the MacBook. But over time, I’ve grown increasingly uncomfortable with the way these companies collect and monetize my data. Although I still own an iPhone (it’s hard to escape entirely), I’m seriously considering switching to a <strong>Nothing Phone</strong>—a privacy-focused device that offers more transparency and fewer connections to big data collection companies. The <strong>Nothing Phone</strong> is part of a larger trend toward more ethical consumer electronics, which emphasize user privacy over advertising revenue.</p>

        <p class="highlight">This process of letting go of Apple products hasn’t been easy, but I’m slowly replacing them with alternatives that prioritize security and minimal data collection. The transition isn’t complete, but every step I take toward independence from Big Tech feels like a small victory.</p>

        <h1>6. Finding a Balance</h1>

        <p class="highlight">At the end of the day, reclaiming your privacy doesn’t mean you have to live off the grid or become completely anti-technology. Instead, it’s about finding a balance between convenience and privacy. It’s about taking back control over your data, choosing tools that align with your values, and being conscious of the digital footprint you leave behind. Whether it’s switching to a more secure browser, using local storage, or choosing privacy-respecting tech alternatives, every small step helps protect your privacy from the prying eyes of Big Brother.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Ultimately, privacy isn’t a one-time decision; it’s an ongoing process. I’ve found that taking small, practical steps to reduce surveillance and control my personal data has been empowering. And while I may not be able to fully escape the watchful eyes of Big Tech, I feel more in control of my digital life, and that’s a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p class="highlight"> Well that is all from me folks!
