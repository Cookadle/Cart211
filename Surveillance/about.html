             In a world where everything seems to come at no cost aka free apps,<br> free social media platforms, free search engines<br>the true price is often hidden behind a screen.<br> The thing is, nothing is truly free, and we’re often paying with something far more valuable than money : <br> our privacy.
                </p>
<p class ="highlight">
When you download an app or sign up for an online service, <br> it’s easy to click "Accept" without fully understanding <br> what you're agreeing to. In exchange for that "free" service, <br> you're often giving away access to your personal data—whether it's your location, browsing history, social media habits, or even the personal information you share.
</p>
<p class ="highlight">
We often think of privacy as a personal right, <br> but in today's digital world, it's become a commodity, <br> something that's traded for the convenience of "free" services. <br> But here's the truth: nothing is truly free. While you might not be paying with your wallet, you're often paying with something far more valuable—your privacy.

<h1> Gotta catch them all : How Pokemon Go caught everyone data</h1>

<p class="highlight">
When Pokémon Go first launched, players around the world quickly became immersed in the game’s augmented reality (AR) experience. But as it turned out, there was much more to the app than just catching Pokémon.
</p>
<p class="highlight">
The game’s developers, Niantic Labs, were quickly criticized for the app’s data collection practices. What started as a conspiracy theory that the game was essentially a tool for mass surveillance—became a confirmed reality. <br> According to an investigative report from TNSafety, the game had the potential to collect an overwhelming amount of user data, including GPS location, photos, contacts, and device information. <br>In fact, Pokémon Go's privacy policy revealed that it had access to a wide range of personal information, much more than players realized when they downloaded the game.

<br> While the game was marketed as a fun, harmless activity, it became clear that Niantic had access to a wealth of user data. <br>Even more troubling was the fact that the game used location tracking as a core mechanic, meaning that it wasn't just your in-game behavior that was being tracked,it was your physical movement in the real world.<br> Players who thought they were simply walking around catching Pokémon were unknowingly giving up their real-time geolocation data to a tech company with little transparency about how that data was being used.

</p>
<p class="highlight">
What seemed like a harmless game became an example of how "free" services can be a trojan horse for surveillance. It was no longer just a conspiracy theory—it was a reality. Niantic wasn’t just collecting data for advertising purposes; the company had access to your precise whereabouts, potentially giving governments and third parties a way to monitor and track individuals.

</p>

<p class="highlight">
The Pokémon Go incident serves as a stark reminder of the hidden <br> cost behind seemingly free digital services. <br>Apps like these, which appear harmless on the surface, often give away far more than we realize.<br>So, next time you sign up for a new "free" service or download an app, ask yourself: what are you really paying for?
