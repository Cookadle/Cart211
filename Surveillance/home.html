     Surveillance capitalism is a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff (the lovely genius who inspired this chronicle), the Charles Edward Wilson Professor Emerita at Harvard Business School, to describe a new economic order in which companies collect and exploit personal data on a massive scale to predict and modify human behavior. 
        </p>
        <p> 
       

Surveillance capitalism is an economic system and business model that collects, analyzes, and monetizes vast amounts of personal data from individuals, often without explicit knowledge or consent, primarily through digital technologies and platforms, to generate profits.

In surveillance capitalism, individuals’ online activities, behaviors, preferences, and personal information are meticulously tracked, recorded, and analyzed by various companies and organizations. This data is then used to create detailed profiles and predictive models, which are leveraged to influence consumer behavior, target advertising, and shape market strategies.

Zuboff (Mother) argues that surveillance capitalism threatens privacy, democracy, and human freedom.
